Collection of things I make to help my kniting. Basically I tackle a knitting problem involving math and decide my computer should do it instead.
I might make use these little things to make something that my mother can use on her iPhone :)

decrease.py: Sometimes you're told to decrease evenly x number of stitches and this calculates how many stitches you need to have between each decrease.

increase.py: Same thing but with increases.

heelcount.py: I wanted to get the most out of some self striping yarn and since I was doing an afterthought heel I wanted to know how many stripes of the yarn was needed to make a heel.

Ideas:
Repeating patterns
